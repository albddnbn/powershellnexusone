Setup Notes

During the MDSolids setup routine, a number of standard
Microsoft files will be installed on your computer if 
these files are not already present.  Since almost all 
of the Windows-based programs make use of them, these 
files are probably already installed on your computer.  
The standard Microsoft files to be installed in the 
:\Windows\System folder or :\WINNT\system32 folder are:

asycfilt.dll, 11/18/1999
comcat.dll, 6/13/2000
comdlg32.ocx, 5/6/1999
flash.ocx, 2/24/2003
mscomct2.ocx, 5/22/2000
mscomctl.ocx, 5/22/2000
msflxgrd.ocx, 5/6/1999
msvbvm60.dll, 8/21/2000
oleaut32.dll, 1/19/2000
olepro32.dll, 1/19/2000
riched32.dll, 12/13/1999
richtx32.ocx, 5/22/2000
stdole2.tlb, 1/19/2000
sysinfo.ocx, 6/24/1998
tabctl32.ocx, 12/6/2000

*  MDSolids setup program will not overwrite any existing version

The standard Microsoft files listed above will only be
installed on your computer (a) if your machine doesn't 
currently have the file, or (b) if the version currently 
on your computer is older than the files contained here.  
If you are running other programs that are using these 
standard files during the MDSolids installation process, 
the necessary file updates cannot be completed and the 
MDSolids installation will fail.  Further, for some of 
these files, Windows must be completely restarted before 
the updated files can be copied to your machine.

If it is necessary to reboot your system, the MDSolids 
setup program will inform you and ask you if it is OK to 
restart Windows.  While this message may be alarming, 
the MDSolids setup program is not going to wreck your 
system...its only putting the most current versions of 
standard Microsoft files on your machine.
