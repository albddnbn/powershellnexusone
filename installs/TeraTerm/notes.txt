Pretty standard manual installation config
Destination location:
      C:\Program Files (x86)\TeraTerm

Setup type:
      Standard installation

Selected components:
      Tera Term & Macro
      TTSSH
      CygTerm+
      TTProxy
      Additional Plugins
         TTXResizeMenu (VT-Window size can be changed from preset)
         TTXttyrec (ttyrec format record data can be recorded or playback)

Start Menu folder:
      Tera Term 5

Additional tasks:
      Create Tera Term shortcut to Desktop
      Associate .ttl file to ttpmacro.exe
      Associate telnet protocol to ttermpro.exe
      Associate ssh protocol to ttermpro.exe
      Associate .tty file to ttermpro.exe

I checked off all file associations so I could pull them from registry and offer as options through script.

exe uninstall doesn't remove C:\WINDOWS\Fonts\TSPECIAL1.ttf

**Is it necessary to send a link to this page: https://teratermproject.github.io/manual/5/en/setup/teraterm.html
to instructors to see if we can configure the app during installation to make things easier for instructors/students?
