# Installation Scripts

Most or all of these installation scripts use the [PSADT toolkit](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit) because of its ease of use and versatility.

A few of these scripts are from [SilentInstallHQ](https://silentinstallhq.com/), but have been edited a bit. I kept Jason Bergner as the actual script author and put a little comment to the side. SilentInstallHQ.com is always my first stop when I'm dealing with a new installation.
